note-taker: Xinjun
### Attendance
- missing: Nirvek (excused)

### Notes
1. survey/research competition
   - DayOne: lack of dedication for developers; 
   - Grid Diary: has mood tracker
    - RedNotebook: pros: very dedicated specifically for developers, basic code-based UI, users are free to explore the potentials; cons: not so user-friendly for other types of users, the word map feature seems pointless
    - Jupyter notebook: pros: minimal journal, supports code blocks; cons: not so user-friendly for non-developers, doesnâ€™t have intuitive task lists
    - Taiga: developer focus, has deadline management widgets
2. Our features
    - Github integration
    - Task List
    - Sentiment Widget
    - Code Previewer (similar to Live Server) (might be too much)
    - More user-friendly interface compared to RedNotebook
    - Project management capabilities
    - Cross-platform? 
    - Collaboration?
    - Account system
