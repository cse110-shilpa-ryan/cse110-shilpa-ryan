note-taker: Shilpa
### Attendance
- Aryan
- Shilpa
- Cielo

### Agenda
1. Present start-up pitch.

### Feedback on Pitch
- too similar to GitHub project boards
- too focused on being a task management system
- needs to be more generalized (not just coding projects)
- include more features:
    - tagging system for tasks
    - deadlines (organized by chronology or priority)
    - recurring events
    - daily to-do lists, not limited by projects
- make sure it is not just a CRUD application

### Tasks
- [ ] inform the TA of our timeline by Week 9
- [ ] research more features
