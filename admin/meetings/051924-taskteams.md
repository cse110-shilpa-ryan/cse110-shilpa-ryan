note-taker: Cielo
### Attendance
- missing: Shilpa (excused)

### Agenda
1. Fill out weekly team evaluation form.
2. Finalize list of features & technologies.
   - only pick features necessary for MVP and feasible to implement
   - presentations from anyone who did research this week
   - for **database**: Shilpa knows mySQL, Ryan knows SQLite.
     - Suggested: Mongo (works well for Local-First)
     - DB must interact with tasks and calendar
3. Assign developers for each feature. Can be individual- or pair-program.
   - each feature must have at least one ADR
   - make sure to update Miro with research and designs
4. Assign tentative deadlines for each task (try to mostly be done by week 9).
   - Goal for most tasks: May 31
   - Feature should be visible, interactive, clickable
5. Appoint code-reviewer.
   - can either be team leads or pair programming partners, etc.

### Notes
   - Ryan created a GitHub Projects page for our tasks/workflow
     - We should add minor features onto the Projects page per our task teams
   - Decide on Mongo vs. SQL, talk to Jash, and create ADR
