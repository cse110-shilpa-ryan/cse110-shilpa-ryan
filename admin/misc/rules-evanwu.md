# Rules

## Our Team, 11:eleven, will abide by the following rules:

- Meetings with the TA will be virtual at 12:30 pm every Friday
- Team meetings will be hybrid at DIB at 12:00 pm every Sunday
- All members should be treated with respect through communication platforms (Golden Rule!)
- Conflicts should first be resolved through communication with team leads. If the issue persists, contact will be made with the TA or faculty to resolve the issue.
- Work progress on various aspects of the project should be made transparent in the weekly meetings
- It is okay if you are unable to finish an issue by the desired deadline, though communication of this holdup should be made such that progress is not inhibited
- Direct responses to inquiries should be addressed within 48 hours
- Meeting notes should be done in a rotating format, where each weekâ€™s meeting is noted and pushed to the GitHub repository

Should any of these rules be violated, discussion on how to proceed further will be had and corrections will be sought after.

By signing this contract, I, *<u>Evan Wu</u>*, will uphold these views in our project throughout this quarter.
