# Project Dislayed on Homepage 

## What way do we want to display the projects

What do users expect to see about projects on the homepage?

## Considered Options

* show a preview of the project page using iframe
  * Pro: easy to implement; solves the problem that the user can't interact with the project cards
  * Con: provides too much information; ruins the hierachy; user may not navigate to the acutal project page
* show a list of recent projects
  * Pro: more concise; provides an appropriate amount of information; easy to implement
  * Con: no user interaction allowed

## Decision Outcome: 

Chosen option: show a list of recent projects
