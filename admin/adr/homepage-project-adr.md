# Project Dislayed on Homepage 

## What way do we want to display the projects

What do users expect to see about projects on the homepage?

How much information is sufficent?

## Considered Options

* show a preview of the project page using iframe
  * Pro: easy to implement; solves the problem that the user can't interact with the project cards
  * Con: provides too much information; ruins the hierachy of the website; user may not navigate to the actual project page
* show a list of recent projects
  * Pro: more concise; provides an appropriate amount of information; easy to implement
  * Con: no user interaction allowed
* iframe with "EDIT" button which will take you to the projects page
  * Pro: provides user interaction
  * Con: redundant, the user can simply navigate to the project page using the navigation bar; hard to implement

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: show a list of recent projects
