## Context and Problem Statement

The complexity of parsing markdown within our project is too great of a scope for the course as a result we need to rely on external dependencies to resolve this issue.

## Considered Options

* Markedjs
* Markdownit
* Commonmark

## Decision Outcome

Of the three option we chose Markedjs because it is used more and has a lot of documentation. It is also still being updated which is a bonus.
