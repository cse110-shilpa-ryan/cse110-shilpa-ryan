# Project Page
## Approach 1 
### Methodology : The homepage will display a list of cards with recently worked on projects
### Problem : we can't click on the projects because each project doesn't have it's own page. The only way to interact with projects is within the projects page.

## Approach 2 
### Methodology : Show a page preview within the home page using iframe. This will allow interaction with projects from the home page (through the project pages) 
### Note : Can exclude header + footer to prevent navigation to other pages.
### Problem : People might not go to projects page, home page might end up being too noisy.

## Approach 3
### Methodology : Do approach 1 , but add another button within the projects portion of the homepage that says "EDIT" which will take you to the projects page
